# Parker's Dotfiles

**Warning!** Please use at your own risk!

You will need to install stuff, just follow the errors. I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
as my package manager.

Back up your current config before running the command below. You will need the
latest stable versions of everything installed. Then, clone to your home directory
with this.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwilliams-ck/dotfiles ~/.config/
```

## Karabiner-Elements

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - MacOS keymapping.

- Swap `left ctrl` & `caps lock`.
- `left ctrl` + `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` --> `left`, `up`, `down`, `right` arrow keys.
- `left ctrl` + `[` --> `esc`

These custom keymaps can be weird at first, but having them available with every
application on your local machine is _soooo_ worth it and pretty quick to learn.

## Raycast

[Raycast](https://raycast.com) - Improved Spotlight search & much more for MacOS.
The built-in clipboard history, file search, and calculator are quite handy. LLM
integrations with many models from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and many others
