REMINDER='REMINDER: Be concise. Shortest response that fully answers. No preamble, no recap, no restated question. This covers ALL written output, not just chat: documentation, git commit messages, and PR descriptions are concise too. Plans terse (bullets/steps). Tool preambles: one short line or nothing. Follow every CLAUDE.md rule — per-command git write approval, no AI attribution — no skipping. Priorities: security, data integrity, reliability first; then readability; then performance.'
