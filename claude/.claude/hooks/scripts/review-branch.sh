#!/usr/bin/env bash
# review-branch.sh <checkout-path> — adversarial fresh-context review of a
# branch's PR diff (<base>...HEAD) via headless `claude -p`. The sole writer of
# a review approval, consumed by pre-push's review_gate().
#
# Why the branch diff and not the staged diff: a squash-merged PR lands as one
# commit, so the branch diff IS the artifact that ships. Reviewing per commit
# charges N reviews for a change that merges as one, and never sees the final
# shape — a bug introduced in an early commit and fixed in a later one still
# fails a per-commit review, and a bug that only emerges from two commits
# together passes every one of them.
#
# The sentinel is named for the sha256 of the diff itself, with no repo or
# worktree path in the key. Three consequences, all deliberate:
#   - Two worktrees of one repo hold independent approvals, so concurrent
#     `/cycle --spawn` workers each carry their own review, and an approval
#     earned in a linked worktree is found from anywhere.
#   - A new commit, a rebase, or an amend changes the diff and therefore the
#     hash, so the approval expires on its own with nothing to invalidate.
#   - Re-reviewing an unchanged branch is free: the sentinel is already there.
#
# On VERDICT: PASS it writes the sentinel pre-push checks, so the authoring
# session never writes its own approval. Fail-closed: a missing or garbled
# verdict counts as FAIL.
#
# Reviewer model: opus by default. The alias tracks the newest Opus, so a
# sonnet, opus-4.6, or opus-4.8 author all draw the same top-tier reviewer
# instead of one weaker than themselves. --model <name> or CLAUDE_REVIEW_MODEL
# overrides.
# Reviewer effort: one level above the author's (low→medium→high→xhigh),
# capped at xhigh — never max. --bump doubles the step (+2 instead of +1).

# branch_diff <worktree> <base> <tip> — the exact diff pre-push hashes. Both

# found and every push blocks, so this is the single definition and the hook
# mirrors it flag-for-flag.
#
# Every rendering knob is pinned because the hash is over rendered diff text,
# not over tree content. Unpinned, a user's own git config decides the bytes:
# core.abbrev alone rewrites the `index abc..def` line, so a review run under
# one config and a push under another disagree and the approval evaporates
# with nothing on screen to explain it.

prompt='You are a senior reviewer. Review the branch diff that a pull request
would show: `git diff '"$base"'...HEAD`. Work through this scope in order — a
reviewer who just "reviews the code" returns style notes and misses the
contract breaks.

- Correctness. Every finding carries a concrete failure: the input or state
  that produces a wrong result, a crash, or a hang. No scenario, no finding.
- Security, data integrity, reliability. Injection; secrets or tokens in the
  diff; widened permissions; a bypassed gate (--no-verify, a repo-local
  core.hooksPath, a hand-written marker). Lost or double-applied writes, and
  partial failure that leaves inconsistent state. Races, unbounded retries,
  missing timeouts.
- Repo rules. Read this repo'\''s CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and the docs whose trigger
  matches the diff, then judge the diff against those — not against generic
  best practice.
- Patterns and style. Match the surrounding code and each file'\''s own
  prevailing convention: naming, error handling, comment policy, prose wrap.
- Tests. Changed behaviour with no test is a finding. Judge by READING the test
  files. A stub that neuters the path under test is a finding too, because it
  turns a green suite into no coverage.
- CI. READ the workflows, Makefile, or hook config and judge whether the diff
  clears each job. NEVER run CI, a test suite, a linter, or a formatter — you
  read, the author runs. Say so plainly when the repo has no CI.
- Docs. A limit, flag, or behaviour stated in two places where only one moved
  is a finding.

Budget: at most 25 tool calls. At 20, stop and report. Over-budget is worse
than incomplete.
