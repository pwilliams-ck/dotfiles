name: wwld
description: What would the lead do. Working method for a repo someone else owns, derived from that repo at run time - its rules file, its docs, its CI, and the lead's own commits. `/wwld <task>` orients - indexes docs/ by heading, reads only the sections the task touches, measures the lead's commit and CHANGELOG conventions. `/wwld` alone is the pre-handoff checklist - definition of done, docs, CHANGELOG line, commit subject, then the git and gh commands for the human to run. Read-only - never commits, pushes, branches, stashes, or calls gh. e.g. /wwld "zerto logout url #282", /wwld, /wwld --help.

## Help

If `$ARGUMENTS` is exactly `--help`, `help`, or `-h`, print the block below verbatim and **stop - do not execute the skill**.

```
/wwld - work the way the repo's lead does

  Derives the conventions from the repo you are in: rules file, docs index,
  CI, the lead's commits. Never runs a git write or a gh command.

  /wwld <task>     orient: index docs/ by heading, read the sections the
                   task touches, measure the lead's conventions, print state
  /wwld            pre-handoff checklist on the staged diff (falls back to
                   the working tree), then the commands for the human
  /wwld --help     show this help
```

---

Run from the repo root. Every step prints the line that shows its result, so the next step can rely on what is on screen.

# Orient - `/wwld <task>`

## 1. Rules

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, whichever exist. A repo rule beats this skill, with one exception the human has accepted: a rule that says to read every doc is met by the index in step 2 plus the sections it selects.

## 2. Docs index

```
grep -n -E '^#{1,3} ' README.md docs/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

The index is a few percent of the docs' size. Then:

- If a doc opens with a table mapping docs to subsystems, read the table.
- Select the docs whose headings or table rows name the task's nouns or the paths it will touch. Read a selected section from its heading line to the line before the next heading of the same or higher level, with `sed -n '<from>,<to>p'`. Read a whole doc only when most of its headings match.
- Print the sections read, `file:from-to`, one per line. The checklist reuses the index against the touched files.

## 3. The lead's conventions, measured

Find the lead: `git shortlog -sn --no-merges | head -3`. Then, with `--author='<lead>' --no-merges`:

| Measure | Command | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| subjects | `git log --format=%s -60` | case, length range, prefix pattern, how an issue is closed |
| bodies | `git log --format='%s%n%b%n---' -20` | prose or bullets, trailers, what a squash merge leaves |
| footprint | `git log --format= --shortstat -30` | files per commit; whether tests, docs and CHANGELOG land together |
| CHANGELOG | `sed -n '1,30p' CHANGELOG.md`; `grep -oE '^- (fix\()?[a-z]+' CHANGELOG.md \| sort \| uniq -c \| sort -rn` | section shape, line shape, scopes in use |
| done | the rules file; else `grep -hE '^\s+run:' .github/workflows/*.yml`; else `package.json` scripts or `Makefile` targets | the commands the checklist will run |
| branches | `git branch -r --format='%(refname:short)' \| head -20` | the branch naming the lead pushes |

If memory holds a profile of this lead, correct it where the measurement disagrees. If it holds none, write one.

## 4. State

`git status --short`, `git branch --show-current`, then `git fetch origin` and `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/HEAD`. If the log prints anything, the branch is behind: say so, and re-run the repo's checkers after the human rebases, because the rules move. If `origin/HEAD` is unset, print `git remote set-head origin -a` for the human.

Never edit on the default branch. If you are on it, print `git switch -c <branch>` for the human and wait.

## 5. The human's rules

These win over the lead's habits.

- The human runs every git write and every `gh` command. You produce the diff and print the command. `commit`, `push`, `switch`, `branch`, `stash`, `gh`: never.
- No `Co-authored-by` and no `Claude-Session` trailer.
- Repo-tracked Claude config (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, skills) is the lead's decision. Tooling lives in `~/.claude/` and the untracked `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- A runbook is unverified until you have run it. Run a procedure against dev before extending it, and frame the change as "run against dev on <date>, here is what changed".
- Work lands as a PR. An issue writeup gets absorbed into the lead's commits; a PR gets reviewed and stays attributable.

# Check - `/wwld`

Every item is pass or fail with the output line that shows it. Do not hand off with an open item: fix it, or name it as left out and why.

## 1. Shape

- `git status --short` and `git diff --cached --stat`. The diff is one behavior. A second behavior is a second PR.
- If the repo keeps a CHANGELOG, write its line first (section 5). If the line cannot say what a customer or staffer now gets, the change is not shaped yet.
- An adjacent smell becomes one line at the end of the handoff.
- `git fetch origin && git log --oneline HEAD..origin/HEAD`. Output means the branch is behind: say so.

## 2. Definition of done

Run the commands from Orient step 3, from the repo root, each with its pass line. Then:

- `git diff --cached | grep -nE '^\+.*\.(skip|only)\('` prints nothing.
- A bug fix carries a test that failed before the fix. Name the test.
- If the rules file demands a spelling, `git diff --cached | grep -nE '^\+.*\b(licence|colour|behaviour|organis|initialis|centre|cancelled|catalogue|analyse|favour|honour)'` prints nothing for US spelling. A mechanical checker rarely covers spelling; this grep is the spot check.
- If the rules file names a running stack you may restart, restart it and read its log. Paste anything that is not a clean boot.

## 3. Docs

`git diff --cached --name-only`, then grep the docs index (Orient step 2) for each touched module's name and for the behavior's nouns. A doc that describes the changed behavior and does not reflect the change fails. An endpoint change updates the API reference if the repo has one.

## 4. Code and prose spot check

- Module header states the domain problem and its constraint, if the codebase does that. Every other comment is a WHY: a hidden constraint, an invariant, a workaround for a named bug. Delete a comment that restates the line under it.
- Match the surrounding code's construction style: how classes hide state, how collaborators are injected, where wired objects come from.
- No new dependency. Adding a package is a design decision to raise with the lead before the PR.
- Tests match the neighboring files' runner and fixtures. A test name is a behavior sentence. Assert outcomes; asserting call shape tests the test.
- If the repo has a prose checker, run it. Fix its notes in touched lines even when they do not fail.

## 5. CHANGELOG

Follow the shape measured in Orient step 3: section, line, prefix, scope, issue reference. The line says what the reader can now do or rely on. A scope that is not in the count needs a reason.

## 6. Commit subject and body

- Subject: the measured shape - case, length, prefix. It states what the reader can now rely on. Close the issue from the subject or body the way the lead does.
- Body: the mechanism that was wrong and what now holds, as prose. For a multi-item change the body is the CHANGELOG bullets. One paragraph per line, no hard wrap.
- If CI judges the PR description, write the body under the same prose rules.
- No `Co-authored-by`, no `Claude-Session`.

## 7. Hand off

Print these for the human to run, placeholders filled in. The branch name follows the naming measured in Orient step 3.

```
git switch -c <branch>
git add -A && git commit -m '<subject>' -m '<body>'
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title '<subject>' --body '<body>'
```

Then one line per adjacent smell found, and nothing else.
