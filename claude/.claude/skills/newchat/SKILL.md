description: Compose a paste-ready prompt for starting a task in a fresh Claude session, centered on a "Context a fresh read won't give you" section. Use when asked to "prompt a new chat", "draft a prompt for a new session", or hand a task to another session.
---

Produce exactly one fenced code block the user can paste into a new session. Nothing after the block.

Structure, in order:

1. **The task** — one line, imperative, with issue/PR numbers and where to read them (`gh issue view N`). Name the parent epic if there is one.
2. **"Context a fresh read won't give you:"** — the payload. Only facts the new session cannot derive from the repo, the issues, or the docs:
   - decisions settled in conversation, stated as settled (with the why in one clause, e.g. "no palette value changes — values are #261's, blocked on the brand owner")
   - exact values, measurements, or names established during the session
   - traps discovered: things that look like X but are Y ("the two token blocks share names but are deliberately different themes")
   - file:line anchors for the places the work starts
   - invariants to preserve that aren't written down anywhere
3. **Gates** — the tests/lint/checks that define done.
4. **Standing rules** — keep output as concise as possible: lead with the result, no preamble, no recaps, shortest response that fully answers. Branch first, never work on main. git and gh reads are fine without asking; every git write and every mutating gh command needs the user's approval individually.
5. **After-merge reminders** — comments to post, people to ping, follow-up issues.

Rules:
- Every bullet must earn its place: if a fresh session would find it within 30 seconds of reading the issue, cut it.
- No restating the issue body, no filler, no open questions the user already answered — state the answer.
- Write values inline (hex codes, px, paths); never "see above" or "as discussed".
